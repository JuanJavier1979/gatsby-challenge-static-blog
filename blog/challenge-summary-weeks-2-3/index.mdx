The last couple of weeks, and therefore challenges suggested to follow, have not been very interesting from a learning point of view. I already knew how to do those bits. These are the challenges: [Challenge 2 - Host Your Gatsby Site for Free](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/free-hosting/) and [Challenge 3 - Auto-Optimize Images on Your Gatsby Site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/gatsby-image/).

But my commitment to not stop learning and practice every day is still alive! I think this is one of the important keys of this challenge for me: to do something every day. Here's what I've been doing in the last couple of weeks:

- Added offline support and basic PWA features.
- Added a 404 error page.
- Migrated from MD to MDX files. (Something in mind coming)
- Some posts written.
- Added an author box.
- Added post navigation.
- Some styling adjustments to my blog.

I already started creating an about page, I hope to finish it in a couple of days. And next challenge is a good one to learn from :-)

[Challenge 4 - Add Third-Party React Components to Your Gatsby Site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/react-component/) It's suggesting to add a contact form. And I like this one as it was something I've always been delaying in my Gatsby learning path.

So let's start.
