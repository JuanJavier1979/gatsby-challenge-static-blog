Last week I worked on these two examples of featured content type components. 

The main goal was to build a "modern looking" area where some elements inside the component, such as the article title, the description or the image are positioned like I see in magazines or other classical printed media.

I did not want to use absolute positioning, and lots of extra divs to make it look like I had in mind. The less markup, the better. But not just for simplicity, or cleaness, also because of semantics.

## Basic example

<CodePen codePenId="eYNwrYM" />

## Another example

<CodePen codePenId="WNvVgzO" />
