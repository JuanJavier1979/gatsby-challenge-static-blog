Hello all!
This is a introductory post to my new blog. My name is Juan Javier and in the last 11 years I have been developing websites using WordPress as my main content source.

It's been a great journey, and I am still using it, I am not going to leave it. But I am a very curious person, I like to try new things, learn through the process and improve my skills.

In the last year I started learning React. I did some courses and tried different things on personal projects. I also had the chance to write a MVP (or prototype) for a real project. It was tough but I really enjoyed it.

On my journey I won a Google Scholarship, the [Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024). This was my most enjoyable and profitable learning XXX. I really encourage you if you want to learn something deeply try Udacity.

The Nanodegree helped me learn JavaScript deeply and open my curiosity about PWAs.

In the last months I discovered Gatsby. What I discovered 

And now I am starting the year with this challenge.
