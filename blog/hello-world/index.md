Hello all!  
This is an introductory post to my new blog but...

### Who am I?
My name is Juan Javier and in the last 11 years I have been developing websites using WordPress as my main content source.

It's been a great journey, and I am still using it, I am not going to leave it. But I am a very curious person, I like to try new things, learn through the process and improve my skills.

In the last year I started learning React. I did some courses and tried different things on personal projects. I also had the chance to write an MVP (or prototype) for a real project. It was tough but I really enjoyed it.

On my journey I won a Google Scholarship, the [Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024). This was my most enjoyable and profitable learning course. I really encourage you if you want to learn something deeply to try Udacity.

The Nanodegree helped me learn JavaScript deeply and open my curiosity about PWAs.

In the last months I discovered Gatsby. Gatsby it's a framework to build websites using React. It's basically React, so all learnt previously it's useful.

What I like about Gatsby?  
- It's open source
- Really amazing results (website speed)
- It's fun and enjoyable as a developer
- Friendly and big community
- Lots of official [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

And now I am starting the year with this challenge: [100 Days Of Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/). The main purpose it's to build some projects using Gatsby daily for 100 days!

### What will this blog be about?
I will write mostly about my career, my development path, what I learnt and what I am learning. That includes WordPress, React and Gatsby and PWAs. But I also plan to write about the industry, how to work, how to improve, how to deal with time, projects and remote mates.

I will share my experience, what worked well for me but also what did not. I will write some tutorials too.

But not only about web development. I will also have a space here about other hobbies I have. In the first place I think I will start sharing my D&D campaign log.

### Want to know more about me or get in contact?
You can know more about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/desarrolladorwordpress/?locale=en_US), reach to me on [my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/JuanJavier1979) or collaborate with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuanJavier1979).

So, let's start the year coding in Gatsby writing this blog.
